# Castle Curses

This project is for my CS-1 computer science course. Ideally, I'd like
to have a Curses-run front end, but I don't know if I'll have time to
actually implement it.

This is a bare-bones text-based RPG (and I use the term "RPG" quite
loosely). The focus of the project is to demonstrate an understanding
of the underlying concepts.
